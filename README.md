# Community Incentive Contracts

General contracts to facilitate greater community involvement for a protocol.

# Bug Reporting

### For a bug report, a user will submit:
    - Description of bug
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Any additional info pertaining to the bug

### Bug Report rewards will be broken down into three levels:

    1. Basic - 500 MOBI reward
        - Includes typos, styling, non-operational bugs
    2. Medium - 1,000 MOBI reward
        - These are bugs that might not break the website but do hinder some functions. Example: A farm page breaks if trying to access it directly via url rather             than through the pool page
    3. Important - 10,000 MOBI reward
        - These are bugs that completely break the website and have no workaround.  Must show that workarounds have been attempted.

## General Requests

### A user can submit a reward request composed of the following:

    - Description of task done
    - Time spent working on task
    - Perceived value add of task
    - Requested reward
    - Proof of work (a link to pull request, transaction hash, etc...)

Reward request approval and subsequent payout is at the discretion of fund admins

### For both reward request and bug report payouts, the following is required:

    - The requesting address has not received a payout within the alloted cooldown period, as controlled by the DAO.  Initial cooldown will be 1 hour.
    - The number of approvals by reward admin has exceeded the threshold.  Both threshold and admins will be controlled by the DAO, with initial values 
      set by core contributors
